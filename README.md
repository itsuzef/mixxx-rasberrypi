## How to install on your Raspberry Pi 3/4/400/5

- If you're familiar with flashing an SD card for the Pi, please follow whatever method you normally use. 

Instructions moved to [wiki](https://github.com/fayaaz/mixxx-pi-gen/wiki/How-to-install-on-your-Raspberry-Pi)

### Important for running on Pi3 - remove threadirqs from boot commandline
NOT REQUIRED FOR VERSIONS v0.9.0 AND ONWARDS
Instructions left for older versions

Between step 7 and 8 in the instructions above (after the SD card is flashed with the image but before you run it the first time on your Pi3). Open up /boot/cmdline.txt on whatever PC you used to do the flash, and remove the threadirqs part from the end of the line. Do not remove the whole line.

It should look like this:
```
console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=ROOTDEV rootfstype=ext4 fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet init=/usr/lib/raspi-config/init_resize.sh
```

This disables `threadirqs` option which causes a kernel panic on the Pi3.

### Optional steps:

1. Use scp to copy music to the RPI after plugging in ethernet (username: `pi`, password: `mixxx`, home dir: `/home/pi/`) or plug in a usb stick
2. WARNING do this at your own risk - this can corrupt your SD card or worse!! 
Overclock the raspberry pi. I found that as long as it has some sort
of cooling solution an overclock to 2GHz on the Pi4 was completely stable. 
I found adding this to your `/boot/config.txt` was stable:

```
over_voltage=6
arm_freq=2000
gpu_freq=750
```

Make sure you restart to see its effects. You will need a good power supply to ensure undervolting does not happen.

Extra debugging:

Plugging in a keyboard and hitting `alt+enter` will give you a terminal.
